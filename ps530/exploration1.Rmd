"Brexit! UKIP! ISIL!" When your old friend calls, she seems to be yelling. Once
she calms down, she explains: "I am in charge of Improving Civic Society
programs for the United Nations, and have been asked to step in to help out at
the UK Office of Social Capital." After you congratulate her on what appears to
be a promotion she continues. "The thing is that over here in the UK, they are
really big on numbers. I asked my staff for a simple report on the status of
civic society in the UK before all of the recent unrest happened there, say, in
2005, before the London Bombings. They responded with numbers. When I asked
them to explain, I found their desks empty, their chairs knocked over, and
their computers smashed, but their coffee cups still warm and untouched." You
ask her about her own safety and she responds. "This is all within operational
parameters. No worries. My problem is that I need to report to the high command
and I don't know what the right answer is. Now I don't even have numbers. Please help. Can we hop on a
Hangout?"

She does not enable video in the Hangout. However, she begins sending you some
code. "Here is what I have in terms of output. Can you explain to me what is
going on?"


```{r}
load(url("http://jakebowers.org/Data/ho05.rda"))
table(ho05$postbomb,useNA="ifany")
library(dplyr)
wrkdat <- ho05  %>% filter(postbomb==0)
sum(wrkdat$hlphrs)
```

She continues, "And then I have this from a previous meeting where they talked about `codebooks` but I don't think these were the ordinary kind of encrypted communication behind enemy lines."

\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
  ### CODEBOOK
  postbomb: 1=interviewed after the bombing, 0=interviewed before the bombing

  grphrs: 6.1.1 Which of the following groups, clubs or organisations
    have you been involved with during the last 12 months? That's anything
    you've taken part in, supported, or that you've helped in any way, either
    on your own or with others. Please exclude giving money and anything that
    was a requirement of your job.

    6.1.2 In the last 12 months have you given unpaid help to any groups, clubs or
    organisations in any of the following ways?

    6.1.5 Approximately how many hours have you spent helping this/these group(s),
    club(s) or organisation(s) in the past 4 weeks?

  infhrs: In the last 12 months have you done any of the following things,
    unpaid, for someone who was not a relative?

    This is any unpaid help you, as an individual, may have given to other people,
    that is apart from any help given through a group, club or organisation. This
    could be help for a friend, neighbour or someone else but not a relative.

    6.4.4 Now just thinking about the past 4 weeks. Approximately how many hours
    have you spent doing this kind of thing/these kind of things in the past 4
    weeks?

  hlphrs: grphrs+infhrs
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

She asks, "What is the best way to say how civic life was going before the bombings? What is the right answer?"

Later, after you had worked on this a bit she calls back, "Hey. Thanks so much
for helping! I just found this code and thought it might be useful. What do you
think? Can you tell me what this means? Does it help me get the right answer
about how much time people in the UK were devoting to helping each other and/or
supporting groups? Why are there so many ways to descibe a single variable
anyway? What is the point?  Also, are there any plots that would help me tell
the right story about this variable?"

```{r, results='hide'}
mean(wrkdat$hlphrs,trim=.1,na.rm=TRUE)
hlp <- unlist(wrkdat %>% dplyr::select(hlphrs) %>% filter(!is.na(hlphrs)))
library(psych)
winsor.mean(hlp)
library(robustHD)
mean(winsorize(hlp))

onestepMest <- function(x){
	## Following http://www.psychology.mcmaster.ca/bennett/boot09/rt2.pdf
	madn <- mad(x, constant = 1.4826) ## 1/1.4826 = .6745
	M <-  ( abs(x - median(x)) / madn )  > 1.28
	U <- sum( x > M)
	L <- sum( x < M)
	B <- length(x) - U - L
	n <- length(x)
	mux <- (1.28 * madn * (U-L) + B) /(n - L - U)
	return(mux)
}

onestepMest(hlp)
library(robustbase)
huberM(hlp)
fivenum(hlp)
quantile(hlp,seq(0,1,.1))

```
